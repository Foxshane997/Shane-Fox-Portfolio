      <p>
        My name is Shane Fox. I am a budding Web Developer from Las Vegas,
        Nevada.

      <p>
        I am currently pursuing a Software Development Course at the University
        of Nevada, Las Vegas. I have successfully completed modules in HTML,
        CSS, UI/UX design, JavaScript, backend development, and React/Redux.
        Throughout my coursework, I have built a strong foundation in both
        frontend and backend technologies, enabling me to create dynamic,
        responsive, and user-friendly web applications. I am passionate about
        leveraging my skills to develop innovative solutions and continuously
        learning new technologies to stay current in the ever-evolving field of
        web development.
